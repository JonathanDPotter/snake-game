# Snake Game

This is my run through and minor re-work of the Web Dev Simplified snake game tutorial.

The original tutorial is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY).

## Refactor from original tutorial

I refactored the snake and food modules into classes for a more object-oriented approach. I added the starting menu and game over message that didn't exist in the original tutorial.

## Technologies used

I built this app using typeScript, SCSS and HTML. I used Webpack to handle transpiling the typeScript and SASS and to bundle the app for production.
